# BigTwo
BigTwo Client and Server

A BigTwo game I made after a friend expressed interest in one.

Rooms contain 4 people each.  If somebody else wants to join, they automatically get 
put into a new room (with a new deck, etc.)

There is a bug in gameplay (I misinterpreted the rules of the game):
Players should be able to put down any hand containing the lowest card when starting.

Other than that, standard rules apply (diamond is the lowest suit).

The default server is for a public server that is usually offline.

You should run a local server and connect to localhost.
